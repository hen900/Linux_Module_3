## Info ## 

Source code for the third linux training module. This is the scoring system backened that is to be installed on a Linux Image. This is only a scoring system so "Tasks" or points need to be installed manually. Copies of complete modules already exist on the Loyola Cyber Lab share so this code only serves as reference.

## Installation ##
An install script will "compile" the scorebot and create an init job for it
